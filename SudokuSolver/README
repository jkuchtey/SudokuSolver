Project: Sudoku Solver

Overview: 
  This program solves a sudoku puzzle with recursive backtracking
  Caveats
    - Files are 81 character strings. They are entered into the program using just the name without the .txt extension
      i.e: Puzzle.txt -> Puzzle. If there are unnecessary non-numeric characters, GetPuzzle will remove them from the final array. 
    - Unsolved spaces are designated with a 0.

Files: 
  - GetPuzzle: Formats a file containing a 81 character string into a 9x9 2d matrix
  - CompletePuzzle: Solves a puzzle as a 2x2 array of integers using recursive backtracking
